[PREP]
1. [done] 测试 node_shell 是否支持批量命令

2. [done] 测试 node_shell 与 commandant 的集成
    + 0nd parameter is the scope, this, self, whatever, this case, self is the ast-tree.
    + treat req.param as the 1st param
    + bind command string -> command ID
    + pass response as a attribute of ast-tree.
    + test async command.

3. [done] 在页面中实现命令输入 -> port from jqconsole. strip repsonse.

4. Port IndexedDBShim 's qunit based unit test cases into node.

5. [part done, verify test failure. ] re-impl IndexedDBShim via Sqlite
    -> There has a sqlite base impl! https://github.com/axemclion/IndexedDBShim/pull/57
    -> sqlite must use at a special version...

6. re-impl IndexedDBShim via PostgreSQL
    -> We can use directIndex via PostgreSQL, IntIndex & StringIndex Column is quit stupid.
    -> create db = create scheme.
    -> depends on node.js v8

[TODO]
1. Define a document AST
2. [done] regist commands via Commandant
3. import http://aaronpowell.github.io/db.js/, this lib make operate on IndexedDB quite easy.

[IDEA]
1. It's good that port node-shell to browse env. But due to there're too many way of making a response @browse. so that, it's a silly idea.
   But port the command parser still is better to have.

[ISSUE]
< jq-console>
    已经足够好了。
    1. 工作的不太稳定，偶尔中文无法输入
    2. 无法复制 | 粘贴 （ jquery.terminal 可以 ）
